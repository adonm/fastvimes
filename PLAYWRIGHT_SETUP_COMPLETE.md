# Playwright Testing Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## What's Now Working

FastVimes now has a **clean, consolidated** Playwright testing setup with:

### 1. **Configuration & Setup**
- ‚úÖ `playwright.config.py` - Container-friendly configuration
- ‚úÖ `.devcontainer.json` - Browser settings for containers
- ‚úÖ Test directories auto-created (`test-results/screenshots/`, `test-results/baselines/`)

### 2. **Consolidated Test Files**
- ‚úÖ `tests/test_playwright.py` - **Single working test file** with all UI tests
- ‚úÖ `tests/test_playwright_quick.py` - Quick verification tests
- ‚ùå **Removed redundant files**: 4 duplicate test files eliminated

### 3. **Screenshot Automation**
- ‚úÖ `scripts/demo_screenshots.py` - Interactive screenshot capture tool
- ‚úÖ Captures 5 key interface views automatically
- ‚úÖ Visual regression baseline creation

### 4. **Documentation**
- ‚úÖ `docs/PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING.md` - Complete testing guide
- ‚úÖ Container setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Visual regression testing workflow

## Screenshots Successfully Captured

The demo script captured 5 screenshots (222 KB total):

1. **Homepage** (`homepage.png`) - 33 KB
2. **API Documentation** (`api-docs.png`) - 97 KB  
3. **Users Table** (`table-view.png`) - 48 KB
4. **Add User Form** (`form-view.png`) - 32 KB
5. **Mobile View** (`mobile-view.png`) - 12 KB

## How to Use

### Quick Verification
```bash
# Verify Playwright works
uv run pytest tests/test_playwright_quick.py -v

# Check setup
uv run python tests/test_playwright.py
```

### Run UI Tests
```bash
# All Playwright tests
uv run pytest -m playwright -v

# Main UI test suite
uv run pytest tests/test_playwright.py -v

# Single test
uv run pytest tests/test_playwright.py::TestFastVimesUI::test_homepage_loads -s
```

### Screenshot Capture
```bash
# Interactive demo (captures 5 screenshots)
uv run python scripts/demo_screenshots.py
```

### Visual Regression Testing
```bash
# 1. Capture current interface as baseline
echo "2" | uv run python scripts/demo_screenshots.py

# 2. Make UI changes, then capture new screenshots  
echo "1" | uv run python scripts/demo_screenshots.py

# 3. Compare baseline vs current manually or with tools
```

## Key Features

### Container Compatibility
- Browser launches with `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-dev-shm-usage`
- Works in GitHub Codespaces and Docker containers
- Proper shared memory configuration

### MCP Tool Integration
- Framework ready for Amp's MCP Playwright tools
- Example workflows for `mcp__playwright__browser_*` functions
- Consistent with Amp's browser automation patterns

### Automated Server Management
- Tests automatically start/stop FastVimes server
- Unique ports for parallel testing
- Proper process cleanup

### Visual Testing Workflow
- Automated screenshot capture of all major interfaces
- Baseline creation for regression testing
- Multiple viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Next Steps

The Playwright setup is complete and working. You can now:

1. **Take screenshots** - Use the demo script for documentation
2. **Write UI tests** - Add tests to `test_playwright_simple.py`
3. **Visual regression** - Set up automated comparison workflows
4. **MCP integration** - Use real MCP tools when available in environment

All tests pass and screenshots capture successfully! üéâ
